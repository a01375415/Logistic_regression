# Customer Churn Prediction using Logistic Regression

## Introduction
Customer churn, also known as customer attrition, is a significant concern for businesses across various industries. It refers to the phenomenon where customers or subscribers discontinue a service or product. By predicting and understanding customer churn, companies can take proactive measures to retain their valuable customers. In this project, we'll utilize the "Customer Churn Dataset" to construct a logistic regression model to predict customer churn.

## Dataset Description

- **Dataset Name:** Customer Churn Dataset  
- **Data Source:** [Kaggle - Telco Customer Churn](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn)  
- **Variables:** The dataset comprises multiple features related to customer behavior and demographics. It also includes a binary target variable indicating whether a customer churned (1) or remained (0).

## Assignment Objectives

1. **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and structure the dataset for subsequent analysis. This process will involve handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling the data when necessary.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Delve into the dataset to gather insights. Use suitable visualizations to comprehend the data and summarize pivotal statistics.
3. **Feature Selection:** Pinpoint the essential features that will aid in predicting customer churn. Techniques like correlation analysis will come in handy here.
4. **Logistic Regression Modeling:** Construct a logistic regression model using the training data, making predictions on the test set.
5. **Model Evaluation:** Ascertain the model's efficacy using relevant metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC AUC. Interpret the outcomes and their implications.
6. **Addressing Class Imbalance:** If the dataset displays class imbalance, employ techniques to counteract this for model development.

## Instructions

### Data Preparation:
- Split the dataset into a training (70-80%) and testing subset (20-30%).

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Engage in exploratory analysis to grasp the dataset's nuances.
- Generate visualizations such as histograms, box plots, and scatter plots to discern relationships between features and the target variable.
- Chronicle key statistics and findings.

### Feature Selection:
- Identify potent features for the prediction of customer churn.
- Contemplate using correlation analysis for this purpose.

### Logistic Regression Modeling:
- Develop a logistic regression model with the training data.
- If required, fine-tune hyperparameters.
- Use the model to predict on the test set.

### Model Evaluation:
- Analyze the model's performance on the testing data using appropriate metrics.
- Discuss the results' business implications.

### Addressing Class Imbalance (Optional):
- Should the data present a class imbalance, adopt strategies to tackle it.
- Reassess the model's performance post addressing the imbalance.
